This guide will step you through creating a new Course.

#### Getting started
##### Login/Signup
If you do not already have one, create an account on ultraPacer by logging in.
There will be a **"Login/Signup"** link in the top menu if you are not signed
in.

##### Courses list
Go to your courses list using the **"My Courses"** link in the top menu.

##### Create a course
Click on the green **"New Course"** button at the top of the page.

#### New/Modify Course Menu

##### Select a source
###### GPX File
A .gpx file is a file containing latitude, longitude, and elevation points
along the course. These can be downloaded from an actual track recorded, or from
one of various route creation tools.

###### Strava Route
Source the route directly from the Strava Route builder.
Just enter the ID number of the route or the full path,
typically https:\/\/www.strava.com\/routes\/\[*id-number*\], and select "Load"
to import the route into ultraPacer. Updates to the Strava route can later be
carried over to ultraPacer with the Reload button. Note that the route must
be set as "Public" in Strava.

###### Elevation Data
By default, ultraPacer will utilize elevation data from the GPX file (if
present) or Strava Route. Alternatively, elevation can be sourced from Google
or the Elevation API using this selection. If a file was used that does not
contain elevation, the source will default to Google.\
Note that if using Google elevation, elevations may not be exported in GPX
files.

###### Source Stats
This box lists the length/gain/loss statistics of the source(s) used.

##### Name & Description
Type in a name (required) and description (optional).

##### Date/Time
Date and time fields are optional, and are the default start date/time used when
later creating a plan for the course. These are also used for courses posted on
the Races page. When later creating plans for a course, a different start date/
time can be selected.

##### Overrides
Optionally, you can override the distance and elevation calculated from the .gpx
file loaded. Use these if you *know* the course should be a certain distance or
amount of vertical and you believe the .gpx file is incorrect, or if you want a
50k to work out to exactly 50k, for example.

##### Visible to Public
If you intend to share the course with others, this option needs to be enabled.
After which, you can share the course by providing the url to the course and/or
plan.

#### Define Waypoints and Terrain
After going through the Create Course menu, the next step is to view the course
and create Waypoint and set Terrain Factors; see the "Create/Modify Waypoints"
section below.

#### Modifying a Course
You can later modify any of the settings above for courses you own using the
"Edit" button from the "My Courses" page or "Options"->"Modify Course" from the
course page itself.
