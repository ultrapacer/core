      <head>
        ...
        <script src="https://ultrapacer.com/public/components/js/up-table.min.js"></script>
        ...
      </head>

      <body>
        ...
        <up-table course-id="5dc742995f5b9b0007339dfd" />
        ...
      </body>
    </html>
```
Replace the course-id with your own, and voila! You get it rendered on your
page.
